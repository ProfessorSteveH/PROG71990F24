Week 3

the big picture of SDLC

sizeof, size_t

pre and post increment

l- and r- values
    - #define vs const

typecasting (implicit and explicit)
    - strong v weakly typed  
        strong: a thing has a pre-determined type.  period.  (C, Java, C#)
        weak: we let the compiler figure it out (C, Javascript)
    - static v dynamic typing
        static - types checked at compile (C)
        dynamic - type checked at run-time (Python, Javascript)

logical and conditional operators  
-> combined with if, else if, else (partially introduced already)
-> true and false in C

loops (for, while, do...while)

continue, break, goto

switch, case (+ break)

More coding challenges:
1. from empty window, create a program that prints hello word then exits
2. write an program to find the max of 3 numbers, output stored in variable named max
3. A character array search
4. reverse a string (char array)
