	// nothing could be more simple...  however, this doesn't work!
	//     but if we think on it, this array has a local scope, created on the stack, and at the end (the return), the
	//     local variables (and stack) are destroyed.  Thus, the memory address being returned to the caller is
	//     no longer valid.
	// for now, we have to declare the days array as *static*  ==> static int days[MONTHS] = { 31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31 };
	// of course, the use of static often gets programmers into trouble: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572547/what-does-static-mean-in-c
