// "Recursion is a sometimes tricky, sometimes convenient tool. It?s tricky to get recursion to end because a 
// function that calls itself tends to do so indefinitely unless the programming includes a conditional test to 
// terminate recursion. Recursion often can be used where loops can be used. Sometimes the loop solution is 
// more obvious; sometimes the recursive solution is more obvious. Recursive solutions tend to be more 
// elegant and less efficient than loop solutions."  C Primer Plus 6th, Stephen Prata
